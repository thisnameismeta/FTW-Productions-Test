For the Whim Productions (FTW) is thrilled to announce that the Clare Rostan Appel Theatre at Appel Farm Arts & Music Center of Elmer, NJ will be the venue for FTW’s first staged production. Be on the lookout for more details regarding our first show!




Appel Farm Arts & Music Center began as a private summer arts camp in 1960 – the dream of Albert and Clare Appel. Albert and Clare were musicians and professional arts educators who wanted to create a summer camp where the local rural community (and their own artistically-inclined children) could learn about and participate in the arts and where they could interact with like-minded peers and mentors. For nearly 60 years, Appel Farm Arts & Music Center has been transforming lives through the arts and its mission has grown to include year-round programming. Through on-site arts education programs, outreach to schools and community-based partnerships, Appel Farm provides people of all ages, cultures and economic backgrounds with a supportive, cooperative environment in which to explore the fine and performing arts. The theatre seats over 200 patrons and is outfitted with state-of-the-art LED lighting.




“Appel Farm has such great facilities and seems like such a good fit with our current and future plans and our production ideas,” says FTW Artistic Director, Heidi Dugan. “We hope this is the beginning of a long relationship.”




FTW will soon announce its first production, cast and ticketing information. Like and follow our social media accounts for all our latest news.
