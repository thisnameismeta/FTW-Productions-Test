Lionheart Theatre of Norcross, Georgia explains some significant benefits of community theatre.


Some claim that the theatre and the art of performance is dying, but we couldnâ€™t disagree more. There are many ways in which community theatre is important, ranging from furthering education to self-expression, introducing change and so much more. Even in the 21st century, society needs the theatre, maybe even more so than before.

There are many forms of knowledge that stem from theatre performances. For instance, self-knowledge is instilled in both the performer and the audience, as we have the opportunity to look inward. We are able to see our surroundings with new eyes and understand how we affect those around us. Whether this is a good or bad thing, there is always room for self-improvement.

The theatre is also a wonderful way to share knowledge pertaining to history. In community theatre, you can focus on the history of the area in which you live, or you can learn about the different cultures across the globe. Doing so can help us learn from the past, so that we may progress even further in the future.
